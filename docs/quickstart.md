# Getting started

To get started using MassTransit, create a console application using:

```
mkdir GettingStarted
dotnet new console -o GettingStarted
```

Add some references to the newly created console application:

```
cd GettingStarted
dotnet add package MassTransit.RabbitMQ
```

At this point, the project should compile, but there is more work to be done.

## Show me the code!

> You can view a working project on [GitHub](https://github.com/MassTransit/Sample-ConsoleService).

A bare bones `Program.cs` is shown below, just to get started.

```csharp
public class YourMessage
{ 
    public string Text { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var bus = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(sbc =>
        {
            var host = sbc.Host(new Uri("rabbitmq://localhost"), h =>
            {
                h.Username("guest");
                h.Password("guest");
            });

            sbc.ReceiveEndpoint(host, "test_queue", ep =>
            {
                ep.Handler<YourMessage>(context =>
                {
                    return Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Received: {context.Message.Text}");
                });
            });
        });

        bus.Start(); // This is important!

        bus.Publish(new YourMessage{Text = "Hi"});
        
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit");
        Console.ReadKey();
        
        bus.Stop();
    }
}
```

### What is this doing?

If we are going to create a messaging system, we need to create a message. `YourMessage` is a .NET class that will represent our message. Notice that it's just a Plain Old CLR Object (or POCO).

Next up, we need a program to run our code. Here we have a standard issue command line `Main` method. To setup the bus we start with the static class `Bus` and work off of the `Factory` extension point. From there we call the `CreateUsingRabbitMQ` method to setup a RabbitMQ bus instance. This method takes a lambda whose first and only argument is a class that will let you configure every aspect of the bus.

One of your first decisions is going to be "What transport do I want to run on?" Here we have chosen RabbitMQ (`Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMQ()`) because its the defacto transport choice for MassTransit.

After that we need to configure the RabbitMQ host settings `sbc.Host()`. The first argument sets the machine name and the virtual directory to connect to. After that you have a lambda that you can use to tweak any of the other settings that you want. Here we can see it setting the username and password.

Now that we have a host to listen on, we can configure some receiving endpoints `sbc.ReceiveEndpoint`. We pass in the host connection to listen on, then which queue do we want to listen on, and finally a lambda to register each handler that we want to use.

Lastly, in the configuration, we have the `Handler<YourMessage>` method which subscribes a handler for the message type `YourMessage` and takes an `async` lambda (oh yeah baby TPL) that is given a context class to process. Here we access the message by traversing `context.Message` and then writing to the console the text of the message.

And now we have a bus instance that is fully configured and can start processing messages. We can grab the `busControl` that we created and call `Start` on it to get everything rolling. We again `await` on the result and now we can go.

> **Important** you need to start the bus, otherwise you will get issues with sending and receiving messages. There is no "send-only" bus with MassTransit.

We can call the `Publish` method on the `busControl` and we should see our console write the output.
